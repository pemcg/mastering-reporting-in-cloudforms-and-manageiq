To use the reporting capability the **Reporting** server role must be enabled in the Configuration menu. There should be at least one CFME or ManageIQ appliance with this role in any zone in which reports are automatically scheduled or manually requested/queued (such as from a WebUI zone). (see screenshot <<i2>>).
